### **LinkedIn Post 1: "Why I'm Building Tale Forge"**
**📅 Schedule: Friday, October 10, 2025 at 4:00 PM**

**Text:**
```
I've been building Tale Forge for a few months now.

It's an AI-powered storytelling platform for kids. They create their own interactive stories, choose their own adventures, and actually enjoy reading.

Here's why I'm doing this:

Kids are glued to screens. Parents are losing the battle for attention. Reading is becoming a chore instead of an adventure.

I wanted to fix that.

So I built something that uses AI to make reading fun again. Kids create stories about whatever they want. They control the narrative. They're engaged.

And it's working.

We have users creating stories every week. Teachers using it in classrooms. Parents using it for bedtime.

I'm building in public. Sharing the journey. The wins, the failures, the lessons.

If you want to follow along: I'll be posting updates here.

If you want to try it: tale-forge.app

Let's see where this goes.

### **LinkedIn Post 2: "The Feedback Loop"**
**📅 Schedule: Monday, October 13, 2025 at 8:00 AM**

**Text:**
```
Building Tale Forge has taught me something important:

Your users know what they need better than you do.

Last week, a parent messaged: "Can characters remember previous adventures?"

I thought: "That's a nice-to-have. Maybe in 6 months."

Then three more people asked for the same thing in 2 days.

So we built it. Took 3 days.

Now kids are creating ongoing sagas with characters that remember their past adventures. It's become one of the most-used features.

Another example:

A teacher asked: "Can kids print stories to take home?"

We shipped printable PDFs the next week.

Now teachers are using Tale Forge in classrooms and kids are taking stories home to read with parents.

Here's what I've learned:

Listen to your users. They'll tell you exactly what to build.

Not all feedback is equal. But when multiple people ask for the same thing? Build it.

The best product roadmap isn't the one you write in a boardroom. It's the one your users write for you.

### **LinkedIn Post 3: "The Retention Problem"**
**📅 Schedule: Thursday, October 16, 2025 at 8:00 AM**

**Text:**
```
Most apps struggle with retention.

People sign up. Try it once. Never come back.

Tale Forge has 92% weekly retention.

Here's why I think that's happening:

1. Kids actually want to use it.

They're not being forced. They're choosing to create stories because it's fun.

2. Parents see the value immediately.

Their kids are reading. Creating. Engaged. Without being glued to YouTube or TikTok.

3. It's simple.

No complicated onboarding. No tutorials. Just: "What story do you want to create?"

But here's what I'm learning:

Retention isn't about gamification or push notifications.

It's about building something people actually want to use.

If your product solves a real problem and does it well, people come back.

If it doesn't, no amount of growth hacking will save you.

We're still early. Still figuring things out.

But 92% weekly retention tells me we're on the right track.

### **LinkedIn Post 4: "What I Got Wrong"**
**📅 Schedule: Sunday, October 19, 2025 at 8:00 AM**

**Text:**
```
I've made a lot of mistakes building Tale Forge.

Here are 3 big ones:

**1. I overthought the AI prompts.**

Spent weeks perfecting story structure, grammar, educational value.

Then kids started using it and wanted complete chaos. Weird stories. Absurd adventures.

I learned: Get out of the way. Let users do their thing.

**2. I underestimated teachers.**

I built Tale Forge for parents. Bedtime stories. Family bonding.

But teachers are using it in classrooms. For kids who struggle with reading. For building confidence.

I learned: Your users will show you what your product is really for.

**3. I focused on features instead of feedback.**

I had a roadmap. A plan. Features I wanted to build.

Then users started asking for specific things. Character memory. Printable PDFs. Sibling mode.

I learned: Listen to your users. They'll tell you exactly what to build.

Building in public means admitting when you're wrong.

And I've been wrong a lot.

But that's how you get better.

### **LinkedIn Post 5: "The Founder Badge"**
**📅 Schedule: Wednesday, October 22, 2025 at 8:00 AM**

**Text:**
```
We just gave every Tale Forge user a "Founder" badge.

Not because they invested.
Not because they were first.

Because they're building this with us.

Every bug report. Every feature request. Every "this is confusing" message.

They're shaping the product.

One user suggested character memory. We built it.

Another asked for printable PDFs. We shipped it.

Another said their kids fight over turns. We added sibling mode.

They're not just users. They're co-creators.

And here's the thing:

The best product insights don't come from focus groups or competitor analysis.

They come from people who care enough to tell you what's broken.

So to everyone with the Founder badge: thank you.

You're defining what Tale Forge becomes.

And to everyone else: we're still early. Come build with us.

### **LinkedIn Post 6: "Why I'm Not Raising Money Yet"**
**📅 Schedule: Saturday, October 25, 2025 at 8:00 AM**

**Text:**
```
People keep asking: "When are you raising money for Tale Forge?"

My answer: Not yet.

Here's why:

**1. I don't know what I'm building yet.**

Users are showing me what Tale Forge should be. Teachers are using it differently than parents. Kids are using it differently than I expected.

If I raise money now, I'll be locked into a vision that might be wrong.

**2. I want to prove it works first.**

Right now we have strong retention. Users creating stories every week. Schools piloting it.

But I want to prove we can grow organically before taking investor money.

**3. I want to stay focused.**

Fundraising is a full-time job. Pitch decks. Investor meetings. Due diligence.

Right now I'd rather spend that time building and talking to users.

Maybe I'll raise money later. Maybe I won't.

But right now, I'm focused on building something people love.

Not building a pitch deck.

### **LinkedIn Post 7: "The Screen Time Paradox"**
**� Schedule: Tuesday, October 28, 2025 at 8:00 AM**

**Text:**
```
Every parent who signs up for Tale Forge asks the same question:

"How long will my kid be on the screen?"

It's the screen time paradox.

Parents want their kids to read. But they don't want more screen time.

Here's how we're solving it:

**1. Voice narration.**

Kids can listen to stories while drawing, playing, or looking at a physical book. Screen optional.

**2. Printable PDFs.**

Create a story on screen. Print it. Read it offline. No screen needed.

**3. Quality over quantity.**

30 minutes creating a story is better than 3 hours on YouTube.

But here's what I'm learning:

Not all screen time is equal.

Creating > Consuming.

Engaged > Passive.

Interactive > Mindless.

Tale Forge is screen time. But it's screen time that makes kids think, create, and read.

And parents are okay with that.
