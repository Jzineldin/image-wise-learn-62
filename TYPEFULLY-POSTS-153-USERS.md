153 users.

That's where Tale Forge is right now.

Not 10,000. Not 1,000. Just 153 people who believed in what we're building.

And honestly? That feels more real than any vanity metric.

Because these aren't just numbers:

• They're parents creating bedtime stories at 9pm
• They're teachers using it in classrooms
• They're kids choosing their own adventures
• They're families in 12+ countries

Last week, a parent messaged me:

"My son has ADHD. He can't sit still for regular books. But he just spent 30 minutes creating a story about a robot detective. He didn't even realize he was reading."

That's 1 out of 153.

And that's why I'm not chasing growth hacks or viral loops right now.

I'm focused on making Tale Forge so good that these 153 people can't stop talking about it.

Because the best marketing isn't ads or SEO.

It's building something people actually love.

So if you're one of the 153: thank you. Your feedback is shaping everything.

And if you're not: we're ready for you. Come create something magical.

### **LinkedIn Post 2: "What 153 Users Taught Me"**

**Text:**
```
3 things I learned from our first 153 users:

1. Kids don't want perfect stories. They want THEIR stories.

We spent weeks perfecting the AI prompts. Making sure grammar was flawless. Ensuring every story had a proper arc.

Then a 7-year-old created a story about a "pizza that fights crime with laser cheese."

It made zero sense. The kid loved it. The parent loved it. I learned to get out of the way.

2. Parents care more about screen time than we thought.

Every parent who signs up asks the same question: "How long will my kid be on the screen?"

We added a reading mode with voice narration. Now kids can listen while looking at a physical book or drawing.

Screen time: reduced. Engagement: increased. Parents: happy.

3. Teachers are the secret weapon.

We built Tale Forge for parents. But teachers are using it in ways we never imagined:

• ESL students practicing English through stories
• Special needs kids building confidence
• Entire classrooms creating collaborative adventures

We're now building features specifically for educators.

All from listening to 153 people.

Not 10,000. Not 1,000. Just 153.

Sometimes the best insights come from the smallest groups.

What's the most surprising thing your early users taught you?

### **LinkedIn Post 3: "The Founder Badge"**

**Text:**
```
We just gave all 153 of our users a "Founder" badge.

Not because they invested money.
Not because they signed up early.

Because they're building this with us.

Every bug report. Every feature request. Every "this is confusing" message.

They're not just users. They're co-creators.

And here's what's wild:

The feedback from these 153 people is better than any focus group or market research we could afford.

They're telling us:
• What features actually matter (not what we think matters)
• What's broken (before it becomes a bigger problem)
• What's missing (that we never thought of)

One user suggested adding character memory. Now characters remember previous stories.

Another asked for sibling mode. Now kids can create stories together.

A teacher requested printable versions. Now you can turn any story into a PDF.

All from listening.

So to our 153 founders: thank you.

You're not just using Tale Forge. You're shaping it.

And to everyone else: we're ready for you too.

Come be part of something we're building together.

### **LinkedIn Post 4: "Small Numbers, Big Impact"**

**Text:**
```
"How many users do you have?"

"153."

"Oh... that's... nice."

I can see it in their eyes. They're thinking: "That's not enough."

But here's what they don't see:

• 1,200+ stories created
• 12+ countries represented
• 8 schools piloting it
• 4.8/5 average rating
• 92% weekly retention

153 users who are ACTUALLY using it.

Not 10,000 signups who never came back.
Not 1,000 free trial users who churned.

153 people who create stories every week.

And that's worth more than any vanity metric.

Because I'd rather have 153 people who love Tale Forge than 10,000 who forgot they signed up.

Quality > Quantity.

Always.

3 things our first 153 users taught me about building an AI product:

(Spoiler: I was wrong about all of them)

🧵

**Tweet 2:**
```
1/ Kids don't want perfect stories.

We spent weeks perfecting AI prompts. Making sure grammar was flawless.

Then a 7-year-old created "a pizza that fights crime with laser cheese."

Made zero sense. Kid loved it.

Lesson: Get out of the way.
```

**Tweet 3:**

2/ Parents care about screen time more than we thought.

Every signup asks: "How long will my kid be on screen?"

We added voice narration. Now kids can listen while drawing or looking at a book.

Screen time: reduced.
Engagement: increased.
