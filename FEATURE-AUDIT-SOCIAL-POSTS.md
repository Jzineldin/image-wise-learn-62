## 📊 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### **Option 1: Remove False Claims (SAFEST)**
Remove all mentions of:
- Character memory
- Printable PDFs
- Sibling mode

Replace with generic statements like:
- "We're constantly adding features based on user feedback"
- "Users are shaping what we build"

### **Option 2: Change to "Building" (HONEST)**
Change all past tense to future tense:
- "We built character memory" → "We're building character memory"
- "We shipped printable PDFs" → "We're shipping printable PDFs soon"
- "We added sibling mode" → "We're adding sibling mode"

### **Option 3: Build Features First (BEST)**
Actually build these features before posting:
1. Character memory (characters remember previous stories)
2. Printable PDFs (export stories to PDF)
3. Sibling mode (multiple kids can create together)

**Estimated time:** 1-2 weeks for all three features

## ✅ MY RECOMMENDATION

**DO NOT POST UNTIL WE FIX THIS.**

You have 3 options:

1. **Quick Fix (Today):** Remove all mentions of character memory, printable PDFs, and sibling mode from all posts. Replace with generic statements.

2. **Honest Fix (Today):** Change all claims from "we built" to "we're building" for these features.

3. **Best Fix (1-2 weeks):** Actually build these features, then post with confidence.

**Which option do you want?**
