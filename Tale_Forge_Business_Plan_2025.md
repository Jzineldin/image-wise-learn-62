RISK ANALYSIS
Key Risks & Mitigation Strategies
1. AI Cost Volatility

Risk: OpenAI/ElevenLabs pricing increases could hurt margins
Mitigation:
Monitor usage closely, optimize prompts
Explore alternative AI providers (Anthropic, open-source models)
Build pricing flexibility into model

2. Regulatory Compliance (COPPA, GDPR)

Risk: Children's privacy regulations are strict and evolving
Mitigation:
Budget $3,000 for compliance (COPPA + GDPR)
Work with legal experts specializing in children's content
Build privacy-first architecture from day one

3. Competition from Big Tech

Risk: Google, Amazon, or Disney could enter this space
Mitigation:
Move fast, build strong brand in Nordics
Focus on community and personalization (hard to replicate)
Build defensible moats (data, network effects)

4. User Acquisition Cost Increases

Risk: Meta/Google ad costs could rise, hurting CAC
Mitigation:
Diversify acquisition channels (organic, influencers, schools)
Build viral loops into product
Focus on retention to maximize LTV

5. Product-Market Fit Uncertainty

Risk: Users may not convert from free to paid at expected rates
Mitigation:
Extensive beta testing and school pilots
Flexible pricing model (subscriptions + credit packs)
Continuous user feedback and iteration

6. Technical Execution Risk

Risk: Mobile apps may take longer to build than planned
Mitigation:
Hire experienced React Native developer
Use proven frameworks and tools
Build MVP first, iterate based on feedback

7. Founder Dependency

Risk: Kevin is the sole founder and primary developer
Mitigation:
Hire developer by Month 6 to reduce dependency
Document all processes and code
Build advisor network for support
