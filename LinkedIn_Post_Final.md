# TALE FORGE - LINKEDIN POST (FINAL VERSION)

## 📝 POST COPY:

I've been staring at this post for 3 days, hesitating to hit "publish."

Why? Because Tale Forge isn't perfect yet.

But I realized something: waiting for perfection means never launching. And I didn't build this to keep it to myself.

So here's the truth:

Tale Forge is live. It works. You can create personalized AI-powered storybooks right now in English or Swedish.

But it's not finished.

And that's exactly why I need your help.

I built Tale Forge to solve a problem I kept seeing everywhere: kids glued to screens, parents losing the battle for their attention, and reading becoming a chore instead of an adventure.

What if kids could BE the heroes of their own stories? What if they could create, not just consume?

That's Tale Forge.

We've got 2 schools ready to pilot it. We've got industry endorsements. We've got the technology working.

But what we need now is YOU.

**Here's my ask:**

If you're a parent struggling to get your kids to read...
If you're a teacher looking for creative tools for your classroom...
If you're anyone with an imagination who wants to see your fantasy come to life...

**Try Tale Forge. Break it. Tell me what's wrong.**

I don't want polite feedback. I want brutal honesty.

What's confusing? What's missing? What would make you actually use this with your kids or students?

This is your chance to shape a product from the ground up.

The product is live. It's production-ready. It's waiting for you to test it.

🔗 **Try it now:** tale-forge.app
📧 **Send feedback:** kevin.elzarka@tale-forge.app

Let's build the future of storytelling together.

P.S. - It's available in both English and Swedish. Test it in both languages and tell me which one feels better.

## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE FOR INVESTORS:

**Subject:** Tale Forge is live - would love your feedback

Hi [Name],

I just posted Tale Forge publicly on LinkedIn and wanted to share it with you directly.

After placing #2 in Lovable Shipped and 2 weeks of intense rebuilding, we're now live and ready for real users to test it.

🔗 tale-forge.app

I'd love to get your feedback:
• Try creating a story (it takes 2 minutes)
• Tell me what works and what doesn't
• Share it with anyone you know who has kids or works in education

We're still building, but the product is production-ready and available in English and Swedish.

Also attaching the full business plan we discussed. It breaks down the $200K raise, 12-month milestones, and path to Series A.

Would love to jump on a call this week if you have time.

Best,
Kevin
