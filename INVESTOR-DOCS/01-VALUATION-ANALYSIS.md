**Calculation:**
```
Post-money valuation = Exit value × Target ownership / (Investor return × Dilution factor)
= $150M × 10% / (10 × 0.5)
= $15M / 5
= $3M
```

**With $1M investment:**
- Pre-money: $3M
- Post-money: $4M
- Investor ownership: 25%

**Conclusion:** $4M post-money aligns with VC method
