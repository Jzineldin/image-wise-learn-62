## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Company Overview

Tale Forge is an AI-powered personalized storytelling platform that creates unlimited custom stories for children in seconds. We combine advanced AI (GPT-4, Stable Diffusion, ElevenLabs) with an intuitive user experience to deliver engaging, educational content that makes every child the hero of their own story.

### The Opportunity

Tale Forge solves this by delivering instant, affordable personalization at scale.
