Title: Created a free tool to generate personalized bedtime stories

Fellow parents,

I built a free tool that generates interactive bedtime stories based on your kid's interests.

My 6-year-old wanted a story about a "dinosaur astronaut who makes friends with aliens" - couldn't find that in any book!

So I built Tale Forge. Now we create custom stories every night.

Thought other parents might find it useful too.
